# Requirement
This is a project that students did in the object-oriented class of [Cégep de l'Outaouais](http://www.cegepoutaouais.qc.ca/). The goal is to imitate a dice game. 

As shown in the following screenshot, it is a game of rolling two dices where each has either 6 or 12 sides. From the "Votre Choix (Your choice)" input box, the player guesses the summation of the rolling results of the two dices whose number of faces is selected from the left-side panel **Types de Dés** (dice types). Then he enters the initial credit and bet into the "Crédit (Credit)" and "Mise (Bet)" input boxes before clicking the "Jouer (Play)" button for starting the game. The game ends if the "Crédit (Credit)" reaches negative.

The students are given an interface with two operations as shown in the UML graph. Except implementing the interface, they can have the creatiy in the implementation of the rest.
